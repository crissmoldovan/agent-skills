# Releases

## Published catalog

This public catalog ships `model-routing`, `agent-lifecycle`, `blocks`,
`request-blocks-review`, `secure-credential-setup`, `derive-codebase-context`,
`publish-agent-skill`, `update-agent-skills`, `release-ledger`, `github-webhooks`,
and `describe-changes`, plus the canonical lifecycle runtime package under
`packages/agent-lifecycle`.

Routing and lifecycle compose as documented in [the composition guide](composition.md).
`blocks` is independent review tooling. `release-ledger`, `github-webhooks`, and
`describe-changes` compose as release orchestration, capture, and entry authoring,
while each remains usable alone.

## Release checklist

1. Confirm every new or changed skill is under `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
2. Update the repository catalogue README with the exact frontmatter description,
   install coordinates, and update guidance.
3. Run `npm run verify` with Node.js 24 or newer.
4. Review all content against the [public-content policy](public-content-policy.md).
5. Merge through a reviewed pull request after CI succeeds.
6. Tag and publish human-readable GitHub Release notes explaining outcomes,
   compatibility/migration, who should update, and exact update action.
7. Read back main, release, installer discovery, and isolated installation before
   encouraging humans or agents to update.

## Versioning

The repository version records public catalog releases. Use semantic impact:
major for broken existing guidance/contracts, minor for new skills or substantive
new guidance, and patch for corrections within an already-correct contract.

## Changelog and update communication

GitHub Releases are the public changelog. A tag or generated diff is not release
notes. Notes must explain end-user behavior and exact update instructions.
Repository README and agent-facing update prompts must agree with the published
catalogue. Encouraging an update never authorizes mutation of a user's machine;
local synchronization remains an explicit target handled by `update-agent-skills`.

Future publication work is tracked in the [roadmap](roadmap.md); roadmap items
must not be described as shipped until implemented and verified.
