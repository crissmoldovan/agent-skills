# Releases

## Published catalog

This public catalog ships `model-routing`, `agent-lifecycle`, `blocks`,
`request-blocks-review`, `secure-credential-setup`, `derive-codebase-context`,
`publish-agent-skill`, `update-agent-skills`, `release-ledger`, `github-webhooks`,
`describe-changes`, `release-notes`, `investigate-codebase`, `blast-area`,
`visualise-blast-area`, `decision-journal`, `delphi-ground`, `delphi-imagine`, `land-complex-change`,
`resolve-problem-report`, `new-ux-discovery`, `workspace-governance`, `report-progress`,
`work-in-external-repo`, `layer-repository-docs`, and `isolated-change-validation`, plus the canonical lifecycle runtime package under
`packages/agent-lifecycle`, the journal runtime package under `packages/agent-journal`,
and the separately installable workspace-governance CLI package under
`packages/workspace-governance`.

Routing and lifecycle compose as documented in [the composition guide](composition.md).
`blocks` is independent review tooling. `release-ledger`, `github-webhooks`,
`describe-changes`, and `release-notes` compose as release orchestration, capture,
entry authoring, and the note for one version, while each remains usable alone.
`release-notes` is the one that makes the semver call and places the note in every
destination the project records releases in; it carries an optional Claude Code
`PreToolUse` gate under `adapters/claude-code/` that refuses a release whose version
no release-note file mentions, and, like every hook in this pack, the user installs
it and nothing installs it for them. `investigate-codebase`, `blast-area`,
`visualise-blast-area`, `land-complex-change`, `resolve-problem-report`, and
`new-ux-discovery` compose the same way over evidence, change mapping and contained
delivery, each naming the sibling that owns the adjacent job and each usable alone.

`decision-journal` records why a decision was made, anchored to evidence a reader can
check, and stands alone. It carries its own CLI as `scripts/agent-journal.mjs`, bundled
from `packages/agent-journal` by `npm --prefix packages/agent-journal run bundle:skill`
and checked against that source by `npm run verify`; `scripts/install-cli.mjs` puts it
on PATH. `delphi-ground` builds a verified-facts briefing, and
`delphi-imagine` reviews an artefact against it from named perspectives.

`report-progress` and `work-in-external-repo` are workflow skills that sit beside the
delivery family rather than inside it. `report-progress` owns the shape of what the reader
is told during long work and reads `agent-lifecycle` for its "what is running" section;
`work-in-external-repo` owns the route to a target repository and the tree the work happens
in, and hands over to `land-complex-change` once that tree is right. Both are usable alone.

`layer-repository-docs` writes the documentation people read — a quick start in every
repository, a manual once one outgrows its README, and one organisation-wide handbook the
others link to rather than copy — and owns the loss audit and newcomer test that decide
whether a rewrite is fit to hand over. The context files agents load remain
`derive-codebase-context`'s; it delegates evidence to `investigate-codebase` and makes no
placement decision (`workspace-governance`).

`isolated-change-validation` sits one step before the delivery family. It owns the sandbox a
change is proven in while it is still outside the repository: the physically separate lane, the
hash manifest that stands in for revision identity where the lane has no git, the gate ladder
the parent runs itself rather than believing a builder's report, the independent review axes,
and the bundle an unattended run is handed over in. The moment the change is landing in the
repository it is `land-complex-change`'s; the map it is budgeted from is `blast-area`'s; and the
verdict it produces authorizes nothing beyond itself.

## Unreleased

Prose for the next catalogue release. Nothing below is published until the version is
bumped, the branch is merged, and a tag carries these notes.

### `isolated-change-validation` — the sandbox a change is proven in

A twenty-sixth skill, for work that must stay outside the repository until it is accepted. It
owns the physical lane and the evidence ladder: source identity frozen in a hash manifest before
the first edit, two path sets a run must match exactly, one observed RED per behaviour watched at
the hash rather than in the prose, the gate order the parent runs itself instead of believing a
builder's report, review on independent axes that fail closed on a hash mismatch, and a static
scan that is unfinished while any hit is unclassified.

Two carried references hold the depth. `references/evidence-contract.md` gives the shapes — the
baseline manifest and its declared omissions, the frozen-install record whose first half is
written before the command runs, a gate result labelled with what it does not prove, a reviewer
report, the scan classification, and a final verdict whose process failures, residual risks and
skipped gates stay separate fields. `references/handoff-bundle.md` is the other half of an
unattended run: every lane preserved and labelled by acceptance state — accepted, working but not
accepted, the dirty checkout, external-repository deltas, the local workflow changes — with a
manifest, a verifier the next agent runs first, the authority boundaries, and a pickup prompt
that names the lane and the next gate rather than saying "continue the work".

The boundary it holds is the one a green run erodes: technical acceptance in a sandbox authorizes
nothing. Transfer, commit, push, publication, visibility, signing, account and billing changes and
live-provider calls each stay separate acts.


## Release checklist

1. Confirm every new or changed skill is under `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
2. Update the repository catalogue README with the exact frontmatter description,
   install coordinates, and update guidance.
3. Run `npm run verify` with Node.js 24 or newer.
4. Review all content against the [public-content policy](public-content-policy.md).
5. Merge through a reviewed pull request after CI succeeds.
6. Tag and publish human-readable GitHub Release notes explaining outcomes,
   compatibility/migration, who should update, and exact update action.
7. Read back main, release, installer discovery, and isolated installation before
   encouraging humans or agents to update.

## Versioning

The repository version records public catalog releases. Use semantic impact:
major for broken existing guidance/contracts, minor for new skills or substantive
new guidance, and patch for corrections within an already-correct contract.

## Changelog and update communication

GitHub Releases are the public changelog. A tag or generated diff is not release
notes. [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) carries the same entry per version inside the
repository, so `git log` alone answers what shipped in which version; a Release body and
its changelog entry must agree. Notes must explain end-user behavior and exact update instructions.
Repository README and agent-facing update prompts must agree with the published
catalogue. Encouraging an update never authorizes mutation of a user's machine;
local synchronization remains an explicit target handled by `update-agent-skills`.

Release notes reach a reader only if they learn the release happened.
`update-agent-skills` carries a read-only freshness check that compares an
installed pack against the published tree and prints the stale skills, the latest
release, and the exact scoped command, plus an installer for an optional
`SessionStart` hook that runs it. The check never invokes the Skills CLI, whose
`check` is a mutating alias for `update`. Every verdict it has is printed as text
on stdout and delivered to the session on exit 0 — drift, and equally the
`unknown` it returns when it could not determine anything at all. An exit code
that means both "current" and "could not tell" can announce neither, and a check
whose healthy signal is silence must never let a failure render as silence. Its
notify mode reports and stops;
installing its auto mode is the user's standing consent to update that source at
that scope, and is withdrawn by removing the hook. Announcement remains
communication, and mutation remains something a user asks for. The update-check
design—asymmetric cache lifetimes, a fenced network call, and the split between
notifying and applying—is informed by garrytan/gstack's update-check design.

Future publication work is tracked in the [roadmap](roadmap.md); roadmap items
must not be described as shipped until implemented and verified.
